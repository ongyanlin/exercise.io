      <h1>HIIT, Pilates</h1>
<h2>HIIT</h2>
<p>High-intensity interval training is a training protocol alternating short periods of intense or explosive anaerobic exercise with brief recovery periods until the point of exhaustion, which thereby relies on "the anaerobic energy releasing system almost maximally".</p>
<h2>Pilates</h2>
<p>Pilates is a form of low-impact exercise that aims to strengthen muscles while improving postural alignment and flexibility. You can do Pilates with or without equipment (more on that below), but no matter what, expect the moves to involve slow, precise movements and breath control. Pilates moves tend to target your core, although the exercises work other areas of your body as well. </p>

<p>Healthline publishes health and wellness information on its website, and it also provides health-related content and tools to more than 40 other sites.</p>

      <h2>Too much HIIT might be bad</h2>

<p>Some websites claim that too much HIIT may be bad for your health. Here's a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/well/move/exercise-hiit.html">NYTimes article</a> that explains why. Although the study highlighted in the article may not be completely reliable due to the small sample size and short duration of the study, it might still be a good idea to do HIIT in moderation.</p>

      <p>I was in Track and Field (sprints) for 4.5 years! However, I had to leave track to focus on my studies during A levels. Track trainings have helped me to foster my interest for exercising! I am happy to pick up this interest for exercising once again in University. </p>
