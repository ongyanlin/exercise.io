      <h1>Exercising at Home - Let's get started!</h1>
      <p> You can get started with exercising at home without any equipment! All you need is adequate space to move around. Make sure that you don't knock into items when you're exercising! </p>
<p> If you feel that your floor is too hard for exercises that require you to lie on the floor, you could purchase an exercise mat to cushion your body. You could also use some old clothes in place of an exercise mat.</p>
<p> You could follow free exercise schedules online if you would like a fixed workout plan. If not, simply allocate at least 5 minutes of your day to complete a YouTube workout, or a workout that you have curated for yourself using your own research. Even 5 minutes of exercise is better than none for your body! </p>
<p> Remember that progress takes time to be seen. Don't be discouraged if you don't see visible results at first! What's important is the endorphins that you're releasing into your body, and all the health benefits that you're reaping from exercising. </p>

      <p>I was in Track and Field (sprints) for 4.5 years! However, I had to leave track to focus on my studies during A levels. Track trainings have helped me to foster my interest for exercising! I am happy to pick up this interest for exercising once again in University. </p>
