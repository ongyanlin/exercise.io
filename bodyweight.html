      <h1>Bodyweight exercises</h1>
<p>Bodyweight exercises are strength-training exercises that use an individual's own weight to provide resistance against gravity. Bodyweight exercises can enhance a range of biomotor abilities including strength, power, endurance, speed, flexibility, coordination and balance. </p>

      <img src="me.jpeg" style="height:200px; alt="me">
      <p>I was in Track and Field (sprints) for 4.5 years! However, I had to leave track to focus on my studies during A levels. Track trainings have helped me to foster my interest for exercising! I am happy to pick up this interest for exercising once again in University. </p>
