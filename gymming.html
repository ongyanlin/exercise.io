      <h1>Gymming - Let's get started!</h1>
      <h2> Check your health </h2>
<p> Make sure that you're fit to exercise in the gym, as gymming can be very strenuous! Make sure that you are aware of any pre-existing medical conditions that you may have that could potentially cause further health problems if you engage in strenuous exercise. </p>
<h2>Attire and things to bring</h2>
<p> Wear gym appropriate attire. This maximises your comfort in the gym and may also help you to avoid injuries. Here's a recommended list of clothing attire that you should have when you gym:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dry-fit shirt or any shirt that's comfortable, preferably absorbs or wicks sweat</li>
<li>Sports shoes - avoid wearing slippers or slides</li>
<li>Sweat towel - in some gyms, gym-goers may lay their towels on the equipment to prevent their sweat from touching the equipment, for the benefit of other users</li>
<li>Water bottle</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an image of what you could wear to the gym</p>

<h2>Warming up</h2>
<p> You can either warm up by using light weights, or by doing stretches. I usually do a cardio workout by running on the treadmill before I start exercising with weights. However, some websites recommend doing cardio after weight training to maximise the strength training. </p>
<h2>Start your workout</h2>
<p>You can follow workout routines online or simply explore the machines! If there is an instructor in your gym, you can ask the instructor for help on how to use the equipment. Be safe! Especially if you are using doing bench presses. Some gym workouts require a spotter if you plan to use heavy weights. </p>
<p>Some websites recommend focussing on different muscle groups on different days. However, it's up to you to choose what exercises you want to do! Since I usually don't have a lot of time to exercise, I like to work all muscle groups during each gym session. </p>
<h2>Cool down</h2>
<p> Stretch your muscles and do a slow jog to cool down your muscles. This will help to prevent muscle aches the next day. </p>

      <img src="me.jpeg" style="height:200px; alt="me">
      <p>I was in Track and Field (sprints) for 4.5 years! However, I had to leave track to focus on my studies during A levels. Track trainings have helped me to foster my interest for exercising! I am happy to pick up this interest for exercising once again in University. </p>
