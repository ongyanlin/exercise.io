      <h2>Introduction to Exercising at Home</h2>
	<img src="exerciseathome.jpeg" style="height:250px;" alt="man exercising at home"> 
      <p> You can start your fitness journey right at home! I started exercising again after my 1.5 year hiatus during the Circuit Breaker period. I started off with no equipment bodyweight exercises. As I grew stronger, I started buying equipment to attempt exercises with weights. During Circuit Breaker period, I bought an exercise mat and resistance bands to supplement my workouts! </p>
<p>There are many different types of exercises you can do at home. </p>
<p>Some of these workouts are:</p>
<ul class ="b">
<li class ="b">Bodyweight workouts</li>
<li>HIIT workouts</li>
<li>Dance workouts</li>
<li>Shadow boxing workouts</li>
<li>Exercise with weights</li>
<li>...and many more!</li>
</ul>
</p>In this website, I will be focussing on (1) Bodyweight exercises, (2) HIIT and Pilates, and (3) Exercise with weights.</p>

      <p>I was in Track and Field (sprints) for 4.5 years! However, I had to leave track to focus on my studies during A levels. Track trainings have helped me to foster my interest for exercising! I am happy to pick up this interest for exercising once again in University. </p>
