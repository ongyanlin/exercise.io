<p>Here are some videos of me exercising in the gym!</p>

      <h2>Running</h2>

<p>I usually exercise in the gym for an hour. I start off each gym session with a 30 minute run. Most times, I run a total distance of 3km on the treadmill. I will either (1) jog at a consistent pace for 3km or (2) sprint 100m, walk/jog 200m, then sprint again.</p>

      <h2>Bent-over Two-arm Dumbbell Row</h2>

<p>After running, I'll start on the weight workouts. I usually do a full body workout, and I'll use different dumbbell weights for the different parts of my body. When doing the Two-arm Dumbbell Row, I'll use 7kg dumbbells.</p>

<p>I copy workouts from Google Images. The image below shows one of the workout images I refer to when attempting the exercise.</p>

      <h2>Squats</h2>

<p>The dumbbell squat is one of the exercises that I do during my workout session at the gym. In this video, my form is wrong because I couldn't lift the dumbbell properly. But I am getting stronger! And I can lift the dumbbell properly now. Correct form is important during gymming, as improper form can cause injuries.</p>
<p> There are many variations of squats. The exercise that I am attempting in the video is shown in the image below.</p>
<img src ="squats.jpeg" style="height:400px; alt="squats">

<p>This video shows some squat variations. Different variations of the same exercise work different muscles around the same region of the body at different intensities. This is because different groups of muscles are used when attempting different variations of the exercise.</p>

      <p>I was in Track and Field (sprints) for 4.5 years! However, I had to leave track to focus on my studies during A levels. Track trainings have helped me to foster my interest for exercising! I am happy to pick up this interest for exercising once again in University. </p>
